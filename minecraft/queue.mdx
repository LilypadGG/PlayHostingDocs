We have a queue system, like other free hosting providers, to ensure there's a fair distribution of resources. This means you might have to wait a bit before your server is created.

During this time, we wait for a server to become available for you. This can take anywhere from a few seconds to a few minutes, depending on how many people are in the queue.

Once your server is made available, you'll be presented with a console from which you can start and manage your server.
