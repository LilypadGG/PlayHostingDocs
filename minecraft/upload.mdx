Should you already have a world or other server content you'd like to use with your
Play Hosting server, you can upload it using the Files page. To do so, drag and drop
the files you wish to upload or click the "Upload" button in the top-right corner.

In order to upload files larger than 100 MB to Play Hosting, you can't
drag and drop them to the Files page. The easiest way
is to use a public file host from which you can obtain a direct download link.
After you've obtained the link, click the "URL Download" button in the top-right
corner of the Files page, insert the link in the text box and click "Download".

To obtain the direct download link from
[SwissTransfer](https://www.swisstransfer.com)/[WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com)/[MediaFire](https://www.mediafire.com),
you can initiate the download as you normally would with your browser, cancel it 
then copy the download URL from your browser's "Downloads" tab.
