It's now possible to let Bedrock players join your Minecraft: Java Edition server, and supports practically full feature parity between the platforms. Note this will only work for non-modded servers, such as the Paper server software, as Bedrock doesn't
support running mods.

First, select the **Software** tab in the sidebar when viewing your server, then **Paper**, followed by the version you want to install - likely the latest if you want Bedrock players to be able to join smoothly. You should see a popup, where you can choose to enable crossplay. Click on this, then **Install**.

Crossplay should now be configured on your server! If you head to the **Network** tab of your server, you'll see the address and port your players need to use when connecting via Bedrock:
