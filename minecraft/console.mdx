To start your server, click the **Start** button in the top-right. This can take a minute if your server is starting for the first time, as we need to download the server files.

Once online, connect to it via the subdomain you set earlier, displayed to the top-right of your console. Need to run commands? Use the command box at the bottom of the console, but make sure you don't type the `/` at the beginning. You might find some of the following commands useful - just be sure to replace `<player>` with the player's username:

- `whitelist add <player>`: Add a player to the whitelist
- `whitelist remove <player>`: Remove a player from the whitelist
- `op <player>`: Give a player operator permissions
- `deop <player>`: Remove operator permissions from a player
- `gamemode <player> <mode>`: Change a player's gamemode
- `kick <player>`: Kick a player from the server
- `ban <player>`: Ban a player from the server
