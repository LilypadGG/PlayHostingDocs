# Interested in contributing?

We use Mintlify as our docs generator. You can find their guides on styling [https://mintlify.com/docs/page](here) - it's pretty much just standard Markdown syntax.

You can submit a pull request [here](https://github.com/LilypadGG/pterodactyl/pulls) if you've written up an article you think we might like to publish, or create an [issue](https://github.com/LilypadGG/pterodactyl/issues) if you have any suggestions for articles.

Try to follow the writing style used in the rest of our articles at [help.play.hosting](https://help.play.hosting).

We'll expand on this contribution policy at some point, but for now we want to provide a basis on which the community can contribute to the Play Hosting knowledgebase. Thanks!
